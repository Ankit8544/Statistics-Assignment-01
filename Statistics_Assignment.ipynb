These measures help us understand the typical or central values of the data and how spread out the values are around the center. Here are some common measures of central tendency and variability:"

    "1. `Mean` : The mean is the most common measure of central tendency. It is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. The mean represents the average value of the data and is sensitive to outliers. It provides a good overall sense of the dataset's central value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Median` : The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to extreme values (outliers) than the mean, making it useful when dealing with skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Mode` : The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). The mode is useful when identifying the most common value or category in a categorical dataset."

    "1. `Range` : The range is the simplest measure of variability, calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It gives a rough idea of how spread out the data is but is highly influenced by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Variance` : The variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. It quantifies the spread of the data points around the mean and is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Larger variance indicates higher variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Standard Deviation` : The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a more interpretable measure of variability, as it is in the original units of the data. A smaller standard deviation indicates less variability, and a larger one indicates more spread in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Interquartile Range (IQR)` : The IQR is the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data when sorted in ascending order. It provides a measure of the spread of the central 50% of the data, making it robust to outliers."
